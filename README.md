# wordle-clone

An implementation of the popular New York Times [Wordle game](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

The motivation for this project was to increase the game's replayability beyond the daily word-guessing puzzle.

A live version of this project is available via repl.it [here](https://wordle-clone.ze1598.repl.co/).
